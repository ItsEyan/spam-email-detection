# Welcome to spam-email-detection repository
## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on analysing a dataset containing Spam vs Non-spam (Ham) Emails found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nitishabharathi/email-spam-dataset). For a detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Problem Definition
- Can we successfully identify Spam vs Ham emails solely based on the text in the email?
- Which model is the best in identifying Spam emails?
## Models Used
- Support Vector Classification (SVC)
- K-Neighbours Classification (KNC)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB)
- Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)
## Conclusion

## What did we learn from this project?
- Dataset cleaning for natural language processing (Stop word filtering, lemmatization, etc.)
- Wordcloud visualisation
- Natural language processing & analysis
- General concepts of SVC, KNC, MNB, and GBDT
- Saving the generated models as .pckl files to save time from retraining
- Collaborating using Github and Google Colab
